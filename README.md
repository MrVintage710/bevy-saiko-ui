Saiko Ui is a Ui library made for the Bevy game engine that focused on speed and ease of use. Heavily inpired by Zed's GPUI ([here](https://zed.dev/blog/videogame))

It is very much WIP now and it not complete! Watch the bevy discord, the rust game development subreddit and the bevy subreddit for it's initial release!
